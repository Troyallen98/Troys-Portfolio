                            My first week of Awesome inc's Bootcamp was nothing but the unexpected.
                            The atmosphere of Awesome inc.
                            is unmatched and is extraordinarily contagious.
                            I expected to dive right into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while being left to figure out the software setup myself.
                            However, Awesome Inc. provided an environment and helped with my extensive questions.

                            I look forward to diving more into the design and function of my portfolio and technical development throughout the Bootcamp.
                            I love working with new information but, my brain does not grasp quickly nor gravitate toward coding inherently.
                            I believe that reading this blog will provide a glance inside my thought process of learning a completely new and unnatural skill.

                            I am super eager to learn more about JavaScript and its capabilities. I'm a little nervous that I won't keep up with the amount of information thrown at us. However, the journey of something new is exciting.
                            Growing up, we never really had a computer at home. So the only time I got to play on a computer was at the library or my dad's house once a month.
                            I would describe myself as a technically oriented person at all.
                            I never played video games or anything growing up for the most part because I gave away my Xbox when I was thirteen because I no longer played on the console. I only cared about MMA.
                            So, I devoted all my time to the art. However, I needed a more secure future than the cliche starving artist route. Computers had always fascinated me, so when I needed a change from my intended chemistry path, Awesome inc's program seemed perfect.
                            I believe coding will provide a lot of the same enjoyment Mixed Martial arts has given me. Constant learning being the most important, followed by the adrenaline rush of solving a problem.

                            Recently I was introduced to Git and Github.
                            Connecting remotely to Github has been a challenge.
                            Once connected, I don't have too many issues using the interface.
                            However, the process of securing a remote origin is complicated, and I frequently run into problems.
                            I believe a lot of the problem is because I am not familiar with computers.
                            Organizing files and downloading things give me crazy anxiety! What if I accidentally download a virus and it corrupts all my code, and then I accidentally pass on that virus to other people with my code.
                            I hope I will become more comfortable with the process.
                            It appears that Git and Github seem to be here to stay.
                            I vaguely understand what it does.
                            But I don't know how something "powerful" as Git and Github is free for any user to use.
                            It seems that they would make a lot of money if it is as good as my instructors say.
                            Hopefully, I get all the commands down, and it becomes seamless, and they don't add a premium package.

                            I go about solving problems differently than most people.
                            I won't say my problem solving is the most efficient way, but I would say I provide a perspective many people don't.
                            I don't believe I am any better at problem-solving than the average person.
                            I think I verbalize my questions a lot more often than some people are comfortable doing.
                            I have taught MMA for around eight years now.
                            It has taught me that you do not always have the answer to someone's question and that it is not okay to act like you can figure out any and everything.
                            People are social creatures, and I believe one reason the human species is so successful is our ability to communicate with each other.
                            One person doesn't change the world.
                            But, the collective experiences that one person has can provoke a world-changing idea.
                            Problem-solving is difficult, so I believe that the best way to attack problems is to collaborate with a team.
                            This way, there is a checks and balance between my ideas and experiences with another person's experiences.
                            Teams should consider all opinions to provide a clear solution.

                            Something I would love to accomplish one day that I do not currently have the coding skills is to build an interactive sparring AI.
                            Brain injury is a big problem in martial arts such as Muay Thai, Boxing, MMA, etc...
                            Many fighters become punch drunk after years of hard training.
                            I would love to provide the world with a very effective AI training partner that offers safe training methods through technology.
                            Instead of heavy blows causing internal bruising, maybe low voltage shocks to indicate effective strikes.
                            But achieving a dream such as this would require more than one person.
                            Solving problems is difficult for everyone.
                            But, I believe with a strong team, someday I could achieve my dreams.

                                    HTML, CSS, and Javascript all play an essential role in rendering user experience.
                                    One language without the others seems to lack an essence of life.
                                    During my first exposure to HTML, I did not find any serious use for the HTML language.
                                    However, after gaining some insight into Javascript, I have appreciated the HTML language a lot more for the structure it provides other programming languages.
                                    HTML's ability to contain subjects allows CSS and Javascript to provide eye-catching animations and simple to complex functionality through thorough and straightforward commands.
                                    I set what I initially thought were modest expectations for my website at the beginning of the Bootcamp.

                                    However, after gaining a little more experience with javascript, I've found that I am only scratching the surface of what a great blog portfolio can provide to a user.
                                    From day and night modes to email inquires, I still plan to make not only a personal blog but a user's experience by the time this Bootcamp comes to an end.
                                    I would love to find a way to make my portfolio a learning environment as well someday.
                                    I document my journey as a developer and guide other users down the same path I have decided to follow.

                                    While HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are outstanding, I am excited to learn more about the pseudocoding process.
                                    I think of pseudocode as writing your ideas down on paper and then slowly transitioning them into code.
                                    It provides an outlet and allows you to formulate your code productively, so nothing becomes too overwhelming.
                                    I don't believe I am planning out my code as well as I would like to plan.
                                    However, like with anything, I plan to practice and find a way to come to more logical conclusions.
                                    Pseudocode seems to be the solution not for coding only in javascript but coding in any language.
                                    It is a procedural way of thinking rather than merely a rough draft.

                                    I believe it was very beneficial to work remotely during Onboarding.
                                    I think it showed what it is like to work from home and independently from other people.
                                    However, I do feel like the Onboarding was too long.
                                    Four weeks is too long and allows people to slip through the cracks when trying to learn.
                                    I believe doing the prework, and then a two to three-week Onboarding would be far more efficient for productivity.

                                    The most frustrating part of Onboarding was how it was sometimes difficult to contact instructors.
                                    Ten minutes is a long time to wait for a response when you could be in a classroom and receive instant guidance.
                                    However, that amount of time allowed my cohort to develop an independent approach early on, and I feel that these choices are beneficial as we advance with the Bootcamp in many ways.

                                     Any success throughout the past four weeks I would accredit to my packed mornings.
                                    As for specific coding challenges, I always start by trying to ask what I am trying to do.

                                    This week was tough.
                                    This week was the first time we had multiple projects, and honestly, time management is problematic when dealing with new material and the added stress of an environment switch.
                                    Remote learn has its pros and cons, but after being in person at Awesome inc., I feel that I have taken the first step in becoming "awesome" myself.
                                    Being in an environment where everyone wants to code, and companies in the tech industry are swarming around provides a unique, supportive, and overwhelmingly optimistic air.
                                    This week, we primarily focused on Bootstrap 5 and Javascript.
                                    With each passing day, javascript seems less intimidating and more of a comforting friend.

                                    I went from hardly understanding what a function does to writing complete functions readable by human comprehension.

                                    One thing I could better this week is writing out my pseudocode.
                                    I got flustered by the number of projects, and instead of sitting down and writing out a game plan, I dropped my hand.
                                    I plan to take more time in the coming weeks to write out my ideas and goals as I advance.
                                    Toward the middle of the week, they asked the platoon to reflect on our "why?".
                                    At first, I thought i could boldly state why I decided to take Awesome Inc's camp.
                                    However, after reflecting hard and going over the central responses such as I like to learn, I want a stable career, I want to think, I want to build something that changes the world.
                                    I have concluded, much like the story of how I stumbled through Awesome Inc's doors, the choice feels right.

                                    This week we learned a lot about the development process, and it demonstrated the power of pseudocode.
                                    The development process consists of planning out what needs to be done.
                                    This process could also be considered an idea.
                                    Then you ask what is required and check for the materials and resources necessary to expand the idea.
                                    Once you have everything planned out, you can think about what the design of a product should look like and eventually lead to implementing the project.

                                    To develop good code, a developer needs to collaborate with their team to create clean and dry code.
                                    The developer must also account for potential errors by users.
                                    So with their team, the developer should run a series of tests on the code and try every way possible to break the code and then add error handling to help ensure that the user experience is excellent.
                                    Together these steps in the development process lead to the deployment of a project, where a developer and their team hands off the finished project to the buyer.
                                    A good programmer will make sure there are comments, and the code is easy to read.
                                    A good developer does not want to pass along messy wet code that makes the inherited coder's job a nightmare.

                                    However, a great developer must also meet deadlines and know how to deliver.
                                    Code is never 100% complete and will always require maintenance as well as updates.
                                    Here the code enters its final stage in the development process and is used by users, acquire reviews and feedback, prompting the cycle to start over and continue throughout the circle of development.

                                    This week we learned about the design pattern, MVC (Model, View, and Controler), and more than ever, pseudocode seems to be the answer for object-oriented programming.
                                    According to Alexander S.
                                    Gillis, a technical writer from TechTarget, "Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic."
                                    This layer of abstraction makes it possible for code to be compartmentalized and easier to read and function.
                                    Code that is object-orientally programmed can be much more extensive and is more efficient.
                                    However, projects that use object-oriented programming must be extensively planned and organized before code ever hits the page.
                                    Initially, I thought of pseudocode as a means to prewriting.
                                    Still, as I have mentioned before, pseudocode seems to be a methodology for coding rather than coding in a specific language.

                                    MVC is a great example of a design pattern that should be object-oriented programmed.
                                    A team may use the MVC model on a large project, where they discuss the project extensively and then divide tasks between individuals or smaller groups.
                                    One team could take the Model while another takes View, and then another team takes the final Controller methods for the project.
                                    Predicting future problems and collaborating on what needs to be done by an individual unit is done during the pseudocode session.
                                    Everyone gives their opinions on what needs to be done to prevent problems further down the road in the development process lifecycle.

                                    By assigning classes, objects, methods, and attributes, developers can carefully dictate what part of a program knows about each other so communication is easier and faster.
                                    I honestly don't believe coding is not possible without some form of pseudocode.
                                    Pseudocode is essential for any large project that deals with multiple components and needs classes to keep everything organized and easily accessible to fix bugs throughout the project after the project's deployment.

                                    This week we were introduced to React, a Javascript Framework.
                                    React is like a library of different tools you can plug into your code.
                                    React Bootstrap has to be one of my favorite frameworks that our instructors, Ian and Justin, have introduced to our cohort.
                                    React Bootstrap is extremely simple and an excellent tool for the base structure and design of a webpage, and all of the documentation is easy to read.
                                    From what I understand, the React library's extent is insane, and I am eager to design my final portfolio project with React.
                                    Next week our instructors are introducing hooks and expressed that everything becomes significantly more manageable using Hooks instead of class components.

                                    I would love to learn more about hooks and hopefully find ways to refactor some of my current projects with React going forward.
                                    With React and React Bootstrap, I can finally make my websites look more presentable without having an extensive CSS background and focus more on the logic and communication between components rather than getting lost and hyper-focusing on the design of my portfolio.
                                    React seems to be here to stay for a long while.
                                    With the new release of the React beta, I would love to dive deep and look into the latest version and see what all its documentation has to offer because React provided an easy way to manage state compared to vanilla JavaScript and was a project that made more sense to me than others in the past.

                                    Going from not having a computer three years ago to pursuing a job in web development has been an experience.
                                    But CLIs have become a source of amazement for me.
                                    CLIs are beautiful, and I would love to create a mind-activated terminal.
                                    The amount of data that would be required to have this technology would be crazy.
                                    But imagine having something similar to Jarvis or Edith from IronMan.
                                    This technology would take forever to code.
                                    But imagine having technology that had almost unimaginable power at the fingertips of our minds.
                                    Most work nowadays is done online, making office jobs capable without ever being at the office.
                                    Office jobs could be done entirely by the brain, and the only work required of an office job would be thought of action.

                                    A CLI with the power of Edith would have to have some form of component.
                                    I would argue it would be nearly impossible with pure javascript.
                                    I would have to find a way to use components with a potent API that has spent countless hours learning security, defense, and tactical intelligence.
                                    But we could use it with something along the lines of Neuralink.
                                    It could provide solutions for people who have trouble remembering basic tasks or even sorting through massive amounts of data and solving convoluted tasks such as calculating really large prime numbers that could be used for testing computers.

                                    React caused me to rethink websites and apps.
                                    React makes development and design significantly easier in ways that are hard to describe.
                                    While I have only practiced with react for three weeks, react made designing more complex websites easier and significantly faster.
                                    It allows communication by layers of abstraction with other components exceptionally easily.
                                    React Router Dom has to be one of my favorite frameworks because it takes away the complexity of OnClick functions for every element on the page.
                                    The React Router allows you to connect and add links throughout your page by adding extensions onto the end of your URL, enabling the website not to be reloaded and stored in state.
                                    After this week, I will say I am more optimistic for my future in web software development than ever before.
                                    However, I do realize I still face many challenges ahead.

                                    The most challenging hurdle to overcome in the Bootcamp is being comfortable with the unknown and knowing that you can understand anything, although it may take some time, so you have to be patient.
                                    Patience has proven very difficult for me.
                                    I want to understand something the second I am exposed to anything new, and coding is not something that anyone can instantly understand.
                                    From syntax to logic problems, web development takes patience and tranquility with the chaotic unknown.
                                    Moving forward, I am excited to plan more of my final project and pull all the things I have learned together.

                                    I would say ideas for my final project have changed some but not significantly.
                                    I believe I am about on track to completing what I originally intended during the first three weeks of Bootcamp, minus some bells and whistles that I assumed were easy, and have now come to a conclusion that will take a lot longer than I anticipated.
                                    I want a simple splash page with an image of me and a nice navbar that links with my portfolio and blog.
                                    I can't wait to graduate from the Bootcamp and begin the next phase of my programming career.

                                    This week we finally introduced the Backend of web development, and I am more than excited and considering placing the majority of my focus toward a backend job.
                                    The Backend is significantly more fun and seems to have a lot more capabilities than the Front.
                                    Design is friendly and fun, but I enjoy the Backend's power for programming.
                                    I'm not sure if I want to design only websites forever.
                                    After the Bootcamp, I would like to learn a Backend language like Go or Java.
                                    This week has gone smoother than any other week.
                                    I believe JavaScript gave me just enough base to understand PHP quickly.
                                    Also, I think PHP is similar enough to JavaScript, where PHP solidified the logic of my JavaScript.

                                    Next week we are going into Laravel, and I was told Laravel is like React for PHP.
                                    I am incredibly excited.
                                    Each week I enjoy programming at an exponential rate.
                                    However, it is challenging to decide on what language, frameworks, and packages to use.
                                    There are so many resources that it is hard to figure out what utilities are best for a new programmer.
                                    As of today, I have been exposed to HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, PHP, and now Laravel.
                                    I would love to take a year and solidify my knowledge in these languages while maybe tackling one more such as Go, Java, or Python.
                                    I don't want to just kind of know everything; I want to reach mastery, so when new programs come out, I have the background to understand why the revisions and new programs are so powerful.
