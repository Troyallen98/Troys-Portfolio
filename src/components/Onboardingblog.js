                            My first week of Awesome inc's Bootcamp was nothing but the unexpected.
                            The atmosphere of Awesome inc.
                            is unmatched and is extraordinarily contagious.
                            I expected to dive right into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while being left to figure out the software setup myself.
                            However, Awesome Inc. provided an environment and helped with my extensive questions.

                            I look forward to diving more into the design and function of my portfolio and technical development throughout the Bootcamp.
                            I love working with new information but, my brain does not grasp quickly nor gravitate toward coding inherently.
                            I believe that reading this blog will provide a glance inside my thought process of learning a completely new and unnatural skill.

                            I am super eager to learn more about JavaScript and its capabilities. I'm a little nervous that I won't keep up with the amount of information thrown at us. However, the journey of something new is exciting.
                            Growing up, we never really had a computer at home. So the only time I got to play on a computer was at the library or my dad's house once a month.
                            I would describe myself as a technically oriented person at all.
                            I never played video games or anything growing up for the most part because I gave away my Xbox when I was thirteen because I no longer played on the console. I only cared about MMA.
                            So, I devoted all my time to the art. However, I needed a more secure future than the cliche starving artist route. Computers had always fascinated me, so when I needed a change from my intended chemistry path, Awesome inc's program seemed perfect.
                            I believe coding will provide a lot of the same enjoyment Mixed Martial arts has given me. Constant learning being the most important, followed by the adrenaline rush of solving a problem.

                            Recently I was introduced to Git and Github.
                            Connecting remotely to Github has been a challenge.
                            Once connected, I don't have too many issues using the interface.
                            However, the process of securing a remote origin is complicated, and I frequently run into problems.
                            I believe a lot of the problem is because I am not familiar with computers.
                            Organizing files and downloading things give me crazy anxiety! What if I accidentally download a virus and it corrupts all my code, and then I accidentally pass on that virus to other people with my code.
                            I hope I will become more comfortable with the process.
                            It appears that Git and Github seem to be here to stay.
                            I vaguely understand what it does.
                            But I don't know how something "powerful" as Git and Github is free for any user to use.
                            It seems that they would make a lot of money if it is as good as my instructors say.
                            Hopefully, I get all the commands down, and it becomes seamless, and they don't add a premium package.

                            I go about solving problems differently than most people.
                            I won't say my problem solving is the most efficient way, but I would say I provide a perspective many people don't.
                            I don't believe I am any better at problem-solving than the average person.
                            I think I verbalize my questions a lot more often than some people are comfortable doing.
                            I have taught MMA for around eight years now.
                            It has taught me that you do not always have the answer to someone's question and that it is not okay to act like you can figure out any and everything.
                            People are social creatures, and I believe one reason the human species is so successful is our ability to communicate with each other.
                            One person doesn't change the world.
                            But, the collective experiences that one person has can provoke a world-changing idea.
                            Problem-solving is difficult, so I believe that the best way to attack problems is to collaborate with a team.
                            This way, there is a checks and balance between my ideas and experiences with another person's experiences.
                            Teams should consider all opinions to provide a clear solution.

                            Something I would love to accomplish one day that I do not currently have the coding skills is to build an interactive sparring AI.
                            Brain injury is a big problem in martial arts such as Muay Thai, Boxing, MMA, etc...
                            Many fighters become punch drunk after years of hard training.
                            I would love to provide the world with a very effective AI training partner that offers safe training methods through technology.
                            Instead of heavy blows causing internal bruising, maybe low voltage shocks to indicate effective strikes.
                            But achieving a dream such as this would require more than one person.
                            Solving problems is difficult for everyone.
                            But, I believe with a strong team, someday I could achieve my dreams.

                                    HTML, CSS, and Javascript all play an essential role in rendering user experience.
                                    One language without the others seems to lack an essence of life.
                                    During my first exposure to HTML, I did not find any serious use for the HTML language.
                                    However, after gaining some insight into Javascript, I have appreciated the HTML language a lot more for the structure it provides other programming languages.
                                    HTML's ability to contain subjects allows CSS and Javascript to provide eye-catching animations and simple to complex functionality through thorough and straightforward commands.
                                    I set what I initially thought were modest expectations for my website at the beginning of the Bootcamp.

                                    However, after gaining a little more experience with javascript, I've found that I am only scratching the surface of what a great blog portfolio can provide to a user.
                                    From day and night modes to email inquires, I still plan to make not only a personal blog but a user's experience by the time this Bootcamp comes to an end.
                                    I would love to find a way to make my portfolio a learning environment as well someday.
                                    I document my journey as a developer and guide other users down the same path I have decided to follow.

                                    While HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are outstanding, I am excited to learn more about the pseudocoding process.
                                    I think of pseudocode as writing your ideas down on paper and then slowly transitioning them into code.
                                    It provides an outlet and allows you to formulate your code productively, so nothing becomes too overwhelming.
                                    I don't believe I am planning out my code as well as I would like to plan.
                                    However, like with anything, I plan to practice and find a way to come to more logical conclusions.
                                    Pseudocode seems to be the solution not for coding only in javascript but coding in any language.
                                    It is a procedural way of thinking rather than merely a rough draft.

                                    I believe it was very beneficial to work remotely during Onboarding.
                                    I think it showed what it is like to work from home and independently from other people.
                                    However, I do feel like the Onboarding was too long.
                                    Four weeks is too long and allows people to slip through the cracks when trying to learn.
                                    I believe doing the prework, and then a two to three-week Onboarding would be far more efficient for productivity.

                                    The most frustrating part of Onboarding was how it was sometimes difficult to contact instructors.
                                    Ten minutes is a long time to wait for a response when you could be in a classroom and receive instant guidance.
                                    However, that amount of time allowed my cohort to develop an independent approach early on, and I feel that these choices are beneficial as we advance with the Bootcamp in many ways.

                                     Any success throughout the past four weeks I would accredit to my packed mornings.
